# 3D-object-counter
Medical Image Processing : ImageJ plugin to allow users to count the number of cells in a sample of brain tissue

Count the number of 3D objects in a sample scan of brain tissue. You can provide any custom threshold to "identify" the 3D objects (cells)
and then the program will loop through all the planes (in the entire Z-stack) and provide you with many statistics (including count).
