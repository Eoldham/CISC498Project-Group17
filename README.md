## Installation Instructions
1. Download the jar file and place it in Fiji's *plugins* folder.
2. Place the installation script inside the *Fiji.app* directory and run it. The script will create the *CalciumSignal* folder within the *plugins* folder. This is where the files used by the program will go.

## Usage
After launching Fiji, navigate to *Plugins* -> *Calcium Signal* -> *Run Calcium Signal...*.

Allow a few moments for the image registration and edge detection to complete. Then, make corrections as needed in the ROI Manager dialogue.

After this is done, the peak analysis phase will begin. Choose a folder to export the completed data to.
